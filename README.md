# Find the best metacritic games

## so many games and so little time

So you might want to spend the time on the "best games" out there which'll worth your time. Nowadays, I find neither media review score alone or user review score alone on the metacritic site is a reliable indicator for a "good game". Due to marketing and various reasons, a game could have a high media score but still feels boring or broken, while a high user score sometimes can be boosted by certain niche fans. But if a game scores high on both, it is more likely a pretty decent one. So I write this tool to help find these games.

### how to use

1. If you don't use [Volta](https://volta.sh/), make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Run `npm i` first.
2. In a terminal app, run `npm start`. It will prompt you to select a platform and desired score criteria first. Then, it'll show you a table of results based on your criteria.
