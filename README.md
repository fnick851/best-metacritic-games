# Find the best metacritic games

## So many games and so little time.

Nowadays, I find neither media review score or user review score on metacritic site is a completely reliable indicator for a "good game". So I decide to write some code to find the games that score high for both.

### How to use

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Run `npm i` first.
2. In a terminal app, run `npm start`. It will prompt you to select a platform first. The tool then shows you the games that score more than 85 for media review, and more than 8.5 for user review. You can modify the score criteria in the code.

   For example, as of June 24, 2021, these are the best PS4 games:
